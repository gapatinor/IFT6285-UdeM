The codes are:
-clean_train.py: code to clean the data train. Input: data set in format csv. Output other format csv composed by                     cleaned text with label. A code equal to this was used to clean data test

-SVM_Adaboost_TFIDF: Code of classification using TF-IDF word embedding. SVM and adaboost are fitted. Input: The csv                       file obtained from clean_train.py. Output: report of performance for both algorithms

-SVM_doc2vec: Code of classification using doc2vec word embedding. only SVM is fitted. Input: The csv                       file obtained from clean_train.py. Output: report of performance for SVM algorithm
