"""at last i finally booked my holidays for the finland trip in august unfortunately i need to work at the company helsinki office for nearly two weeks out of the month that we gone which is a bit pants really but my boss is going to be on holiday during that time and she needs me to cover for her DOTS i hoping that we can do the round trip at some point during the holiday but i still have to convince my better half that it worth the extra cost stockholm is a great city but i only visited it twice and i like to spend some more time there sampling the local food and seeing the sights i really am looking forward to the trip this year in the past i guess i been a little apprehensive about going up north but now on top of the other reasons it be great to escape the heat of the south of france for nearly a month one of the things i most looking forward to is the sauna now the saunas in finland mostly are like the skanky jobs you get in your local gym real finnish saunas are little huts out in the middle of the forest by a lake and made of wood they take over an hour to heat up powered by wood from the surrounding forest of course and once they hot the temperature is around degrees celsius not exactly the ideal temperature to preserve in to put it lightly DOTS once you stipped down to your birthday suit either with your better half or your fellow family members you sit in that scorching humid heat occasionaly beating yourself with eucalyptus leaves and chucking water onto the hot coals above the fire for about five minutes after that time when you can practically feel your skin starting to turn pink you open the sauna door leg it down to the nearby lake and quickly wade into the cool refreshing read bloody freezing water before heading back shaking with the cold to the welcoming warmth of the sauna repeat this until you ca take it any more or until the sauna gets too cold and then wash dry off and head inside for some freshly sausages and cider one fantasic thing about the sauna is how fast you get pissed afterwards STRONG! you can just imagine how your body is after all that heat so gulping down a bottle of cool cider is practically like downing a couple of shots of straight vodka on your average evening out quite funny really and definitely a feel good time especially with some decent sausages to accompany it DOTS """,1

tempest DOTS check my profile for more info on that more on silver falcons sfs silver falcons are in fact a failed experiment created by satan yep the devil they escaped from his lair and have retreated to the earth often teased and forced to bear ridicule and slander by other falcons silver falcons were considered the black sheeps of the falcons they were as such forced to keep their silver feathers and their capabilities a secret generations passed and came along scott a young silver falcon who inherited a large training centre for falcons to practice their flying fighting and hunting skills however when silver falcons were imprisoned in satan lair some falcons remained behind and those falcons and their descendants attacked scott centre there scott and his fellow silver falcons were forced to reveal their secret their silver feathers after a while scott managed to comandeer a large battleship comissioned by the dark silver falcons called the tcv thunder the thunder was the silver falcon mobile base until some falcons decided to leave the ship behind and start large aerial cities the silver falcons have a strong military yet perfer to sort things out peacefully rather than resorting to violence they will however engage dark silver falcons on sight currently there several weapons craft and silver abilities that are used by the sf military craft lightly armored but highly manoeuverable craft medium bomber with autolasers that help defend the main craft interceptor craft used to destroy craft at long range often used to destroy bombers slow moving light bomber weak against enemy air heavy carpet bomber popular abilities silver falcons are trained to mostly improvise when using their elements in combat each silver falcon has a special ability that uses whenever taken heavy damage the ability varies on falcon to falcon at higher levels however there four extremely powerful attacks silver falcons can use at any time though it requires a lot of energy aerovis thundaris aerovis frostavis aerovis firavis and aerovis hydrovis notable silver falcons scott leader of the silver falcons on the aerial battleship tcv thunder thunder element ariel

"""us press as stenographers for bush war this is long but an excellent analysis relating to my entry from march urllink reuters reports that the university of maryland center for international and security studies released a report on tuesday slamming the us press for not questioning the arguments put forward by the bush administration for war and acting as a virtual stenographer for the white house interestingly susan moeller the author of the report argued that the pyramid style of news writing which places the most information first produced much greater attention to the administration point of view on wmd issues at the expense of alternative perspectives i suppose she means that in an american context whatever the president says would always go in the first paragraph and scott ritter comments would come several paragraphs down even though ritter knew what he was talking about with regard to iraq weapons of mass destruction and bush did not the inverted pyramid style is favored in us journalism but is not necessarily used in other countries french news columns often are more essayistic and likewise arabic news i spent a year one time mainly putting wire reports into english and arranging them in inverted pyramid form which is not how they arrived while it may be appealing to journalists to try to blame the form of their writing for such lapses however there are many better explanations in my view the us print press is largely a capitalist press which means you are trying to sell newspapers the old saw was that anyone can own a newspaper all you need is a million dollars that makes it a reader press not a writer you have to give readers what they want or else they wo plunk down their cents if the mood of the country is such that of the people are supporting a war in iraq challenging the need for that war could make the newspaper unpopular and its sales might plummet advertisers could also pull their ads from an unpatriotic rag journalists thrive on access if you anger the bush administration then you are likely to be completely cut off from leaks there is a strong incentive not to call bush administration officials liars if you have to deal with them every day and hope to get more than platitudes from them this is why paul krugman who is in princeton and writes abstract analysis of policy that does not depend on insider sources is such a brilliant dissector of the dishonesty and hypocrisy of the bushies he can tell them to jump in the lake journalists are mostly generalists they are talented at pulling information about a new subject out of the experts and putting it together coherently i worked for a newspaper once and so know a little about how hectic their lives are and what new challenges they face every day but the fact is that most american journalists in the fall of had no idea what iraq was like or what a shiite was or the difference between an ayatollah and a grand ayatollah they had no independent means of gauging whether iraq had a nuclear weapons program or not and had to go by what the experts said if you do follow a place like iraq for thirty years as i have you do have a good sense of what is plausible and what is not then how do you tell what an expert is judith miller of the nyt thought ahmad chalabi looked like an expert he was a major expatriate iraqi politician khidir hamza a former baathist nuclear scientist looked like an expert i think the journalists prefnc for powerful insiders as sources is a problem with the trade in this case scott ritter was the better source and even he exaggerated iraqi wmd journalists are often part of the political establishment themselves judith miller is a neocon who with the highly unreliable laura mylroie and so was predisposed to buy the nonsense she was fed by chalabi and his contexts the nyt seems to have a fair number of neocons on its staff for a supposedly liberal newspaper journalism does not practice or sometimes sufficiently respect peer review as editor of the international journal of middle east studies for cambridge university press when i receive an article on iraq i send it out to five or so of the major experts on iraq in universities if they all come back and say it is weak in evidence and argument i do publish it this way of proceeding ensures that articles in my journal are solid there is no time to ref newspaper articles though some national magazines like the nation do excellent fact checking we can contrast academic peer review to the practice at think tanks the american enterprise institute just publishes the book without peer review it publishes books that push or support policies to which the think tank is dedicated this is why silly books like those of mylroie or khidir hamza can see print and sometimes even sell well some journalists do not know the difference between a solid book by peter sluglett on iraq published by a major academic press and some screed put out of a washington think tank by someone who does not know arabic and has never been in an archive i hasten to add that there are lots of real intellectuals in the ranks of journalists and there are even many former academics who know these distinctions all too well but i believe they are a minority lee bollinger at columbia university is thinking seriously about how this sort of problem could be solved by tinkering with the degree program in journalism there i have to say that often when i watch television or read the mainstream press and i see this parade of experts who say the damnedest things i feel like alice in wonderland no such shoddy rhetoric or posturing could be gotten away with in my department but here are people who make literally hundreds of thousands of dollars from peddling unsound information the rise of expert and journalistic blogging and the way it is interacting with professional journalism may well change these dynamics a bit blogging need be a capitalist enterprise and where it is not it can afford to be more writerly it can tell readers things at some length that are too complex or controversial for the print media it can allow voices to be heard that contradict

"""i dedicate this update to a dear friend of mine whom i last seen his smile on february his name is chong csen dik DOTS and are known to us as aki riku the eldest son in the whole family he was a perfect senior to fool with everyday after school basically you wo find him in class most of the time he another one of those naughty and students that most teachers wo want to handle i knew him through his sister aki reiko reiko was my best friend since the first day i entered junior high she was the one who introduced me to the chinese society in this new environment of mine in which i thought would suck ah well DOTS for a nao girl like me it does matter i still remember that every afternoon after school reiko and i will walk home discussing and sharing what had happened on that day since i in a different class and there goes riding his bmx snatching my books or my bag away from me with a bunch of his friends he a playful chap from day one for several times since the first time i have been introduced to him he had been playfully serious saying be my girlfriend and i would throw him the rolling eyes frown and says that he crazy reiko would often say he mad and he a total pain in the ass DOTS and truthfully i missed those days i missed his loud mouth his spirit and his smile i missed him the last time i seen him was on a friday afternoon february he was driving his red kancil and passed us with a cute smile waving he had already graduated that time he left his hair to grow long and dyed it in shades of brown and blonde he looks totally cute that time and that was one smile in which will be rembd forever ryujin hyuzu and me was in my otousan car ryusuke was driving two days after a sunday DOTS on february ryusuke had just came home from his girlfriends house his face was pretty pale but he came home with a and still manage to check wether i had known about the news or not i was totally clueless ironing my school uniform getting all ready for the big hectic monday he walked towards the pc and stopped the songs that i listed to play ryusuke walked into the dry kitchen and confronted me did you hear about it yet DOTS riku DOTS had passed away DOTS in an accident he slowly told me i stared at him strange life and death is not a joke you moron DOTS i snapped at him still thinking he was joking i not DOTS joking there was person in the car two passed away this evening in the hospital DOTS one of them was riku DOTS he pulled out a chair and sat on the mozaic dining table i remained in silence halted to me all that were plain lies some absurd joke they still in critical condition he just stared the kitchen floor i stopped doing what i was doing earlier and headed to call hyuzu DOTS in hopes she might have known more than what i had heard from my brother i told hyuzu everything and she too thought i was out of my mind hyuzu was very sceptical she chose to wait for a bigger anoucemt i then called niji niji filled me in about the accident and said she had also heard that had passed away and all of a sudden yakumo appeared in my mind niji said that the number of confirmed people involved in that accident was but has yet to know who the other were dead concerned i soon found out that yakumo had rejected the bunch offer to go to genting highlands that night it was a gloomy monday morning yumi was the first i met and she had already received the news on sunday first thing in the morning she was all quiet all the chinese girls and guys were silent all waiting for the moment of truth for news to be announced by the headmistress i was alright in fact i did not shed a tear since i heard the news i could cry DOTS but i remember i could bear to keep it anymore when the whole school gasped in a grave surprise upon the anoucemt i believe in what i could do now if you just let me do it one last time DOTS riku words of rang in my head brings me back DOTS the training seion of sports day has begun and that was when we got a news that has a motorcycle accident and he sprained his ankles so badly he could not walk for almost a week when he has done resting he quickly came back for track and field trainings he was one of the best chinese sprinters in our school and one of the best in green house in which i too was a committee i became his personal and yumi was the DOTS we would tag along with him in any event i rembd there was once DOTS on a training day in which yumi and i were both not needed to attend DOTS i still make it an effort to go to the school field to check condition after that day the guys actually spread rumours about me being his girlfriend since i attending every one of his training which is a must since i am one of the green house sprinters and one of the first aid team members and took care of him he is doing very good he should stop one of the lady teachers told me doctors said if he goes on doing it he not be able to run for his whole life yumi looked at me pale was still adjusting the bandages and all on the starting line where the other track runners and coach gets ready yumi pulled me to go advise him to stop he did listen and told us that he alright it is our league to stop him both me and yumi are just his normal juniors that he meets once in a while DOTS during the final trainings i met him in the canteen and he was sitting on the bench changing his shoes and getting ready to go DOTS i approached him surprisingly my heart was not in storm i sat beside him and asked him not to run he smiled at me and asked why was i so worried you our hope for green house to win this year DOTS do go on you might hurt yourself today with a light tug on his sleeves i never done something this daring before really STRONG! he left with an i be alright as what i had feared he made the wrong move and stumbled i quickly ran to his aid as he crawled to the side of the track without wanting to be in other runners way he moaned in pain but i could do anything but to call for the teachers and senior medics to help me aid him he was carried in to where he could rest and go see the doctor after that on the big day even though the green house coach had warned him not to enter the tracks he approached there was enough runners to cover the list sent himself to the track it was my dream DOTS my dream to be malaysia proud sprinter DOTS but i know i ca this is my final year here if i do get selected this time i never get in DOTS he looked far out to the finishing line i want to run for my dreams DOTS i want to run for my country DOTS i want to run for this school he left i was being called in to get ready for the run and as i walked towards the green house camp i heard friends screaming go on STRONG! and look backwards was fumbling in his steps and struggled to stay on his feets but crashed instead he was the leading one out of the runners but his fall has failed him however he did not lost in that race DOTS he was the winner in everyone of the green house committees and coach heart til today DOTS i have never been able to summon the courage to ask reiko about the location of altar in the temple DOTS reiko and i had grown apart since year because we both have seperate lives then we did remained good friends though and i had never ask about how she was since the day i had heard about the accident DOTS what the heck are you doing to your lab reports STRONG! what are these sea horses and clown fishes doin here STRONG! kouri reiko best friend asked her at the assembly one day this two clown fishes DOTS my dearest and myself DOTS the other one here is my brother DOTS STRONG! she continued with a big smile and the sweet grin on her fair and rosy complexion i who was listening by the side was so touched by her courage and will power to leave the past frames and move on it true that no one cold turn back time and no one could bring back the dead it just comforting enough to know that even though he not visible anymore spirit forever lingers in the hearts of every single person who had knew him and he thought me some of the most important lessons in life DOTS and now he still teaching me teaching me how to appreciate life teaching me that even though his light has been dimmed the others must still shine and go on living teaching me to tell how important someone is to me if only i had learnt to tell you how important you are to me if only DOTS i had learnt to appreciate you before this ende well DOTS heh DOTS i guess this is the first time i writing a heart chapter for my journal i not very good as expressing what

for dental surgery tomorrow and currently am trying to maintain a straight face while there is throbbing pain in my right upper jaw i went to the dentist bright andearly this morningand after she took and found the source of the pain she setup an endodontist appointment for tomorrow afternoon the endodontist performs root canals every day all day that all they do they will shoot my gums with novacaine drill my tooth open saw it down to a nub scrape out all the diseased pulp and fill it with fake pulp stuff push tiny pins into the root system to make sure the roots are filled push those pins in and out in and out while they make this sort of noise that makes me think of squeaky clean tupperware just washed and then put on a temporary tooth until my dentist fits me for a crown a few weeks later because of the placement of the tooth and because my roots are small and hard to get to and basically knarly and require special attention i had root canals in one othertooth before and because i have no health insurance because i am an author and therefore and therefore health insurance is ridiculously expensive for people like me and do even get me started on how much i hate the fact that people who need healthcare the most do not usually get it and how much this country needs an organized form of healthcare and dental care and because the tooth is basically screwed beyond repair and i do not want it pulled because then it will mess up all my other teeth and so on and so forth i am going to a specialist tomorrow to scrape out all the insides and make a new internal root system and then back to my dentist to put on a fake tooth and pretend it never happened i have done this before this is not new to me having a root canal about bucks getting rid of this pain priceless actually i do know about the priceless part do you know what you can do with especially if you stretch it out i keep thinking of tempurpedic beds i want and another touch up lasik surgery and trips to aruba and how i do really forgive me even know where aruba is i keep wishing i had perfect teeth that never required this sort of special attention i am getting very personal here i know but i think a lot of people can relate maybe it just the painkillers talking but DOTS dentistry is nice and all but what did we do before all of this technology no one cared if they had crooked teeth or only two teeth it was part of the human condition who else thinks it abnormal to keep a dead tooth and fill it in with cement and cover it with a fake tooth to pretend it still serves a purpose i have also realized over a few days time that no matter how adult you are about something no matter how you let things go over and over again no matter how zen and forgiving you are no matter how you try to remedy situations by being kind and facing them by doing what is right by being graceful and forthright some people are just poisonous there are people in the world who are so soulless so empty and full of lies andenvious and hateful that they will always try to damage anyone they encounter who is better off out of spite they know they will never be repaired so they try to destroy anything good in their path i tried recently after too much time of beingassaulted by a poisnue of thesesorts as small as the assault was because she matters so little in the general scheme of things to be an adult to try to see the humanity in someone else to reach out a hand and be the bigger person and i got what i knew she had inside more poison i would feel sorry for this vessel of negativity if i thought she had a soulinside to pity instead i am left with the truth there is nothing there and so there is nothing to feelsorry for those close to me especially the one who loves me most know this to be the case already i had been warned before they manage to maintain a safe distance they do let her know what they know about her and so i believe she thinks she has allies in them i had been told about her insanity her jealously her unbelievable dysfunctions and still i suppose i wanted to believe that every human being had a purpose but now i realize that some people are just here to waste oxygen and try to cause problems andit was merely human of me to defend myself afterconstant unwarrantedhatefulness but when i did when i confronted the beast andwanted to understand a reasoning for the hideous and childish behavior she displays i also realized after being reminded by the one who loves me that these types are useless to try and be adult with you ca argue with crazy this kind is so menial thatis my her be a flea on a dog somewhere else i got better things to swat at i sure i have to run into her again at some point in the near future but now i feel satisfied now i understand i can smile at her the next time she or a kind like her are trying to suck the life out of the room and i now know that whatever happens you can eithercomplain about the stench or you canstay away from trash i babbling a bit i know and it is probably that these tooth soothers are also a bit of truth serum and maybe i feel strongly enough about what i learned to share it with you because we all have
